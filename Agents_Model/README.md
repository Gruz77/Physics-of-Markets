## Grand canonical minority game
- Agent model of speculators and producers (predictability providers)
- Study the dynamics of predictability as a function of the evolution of the model's parameters (example: too many speculators for not enough producers -> lack of predictability -> explosion of fluctuations because they learn from the noise -> herding)

## Market gains and impacts 
- Study of the average gain of producers and speculation according to the evolution of the two parties
- Study of the difference between the real and expected gain of an agent entering the game
